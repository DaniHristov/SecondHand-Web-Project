## üëì Project Introduction
***
**SecondHand** is my defense project for **ASP.NET Core** course at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/ "SoftUni") (June-August 2021).
<br />

## ‚úèÔ∏è Overview
***
**SecondHand** is a site that represents a platform for selling and buying clothes which are second hand .
<br />

>Each **Seller** can add products to the website!When a product is added it is non-public, it should wait for an administrator approval who eventually will make it public.

>Each **User** can search for products by criteria such as *brand, price, title* and then can add it to shoppingcart and eventually order them by signing a single form .Afterwards the seller will receive an Incoming Order and he'll get to chose either to accept or delete the given order!
<br />

There is only one registered administrator in the platform. It receives information about added products. The administrator can make products either public or non-public!
