<br />

## ‚úèÔ∏è Overview
***
**SecondHand** is a site that represents a platform for selling and buying clothes which are second hand .
<br />

>Each **Seller** can add products to the website!

>Each **user** can search for products by criteria such as *brand, price, title* and then can add it to shoppingcart and eventually order them by signing a single form .Afterwards the seller will receive an Incoming Order and he'll get to chose either to accept or delete the given order!
<br />

There is only one registered administrator in the platform. It receives information about registered users, services and reservations. The administrator can show or hide products.
